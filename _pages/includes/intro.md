# About me
I graduated from Electronic and Computer Engineering department in HongKong University of Science and Technology (HKUST，香港科技大学) with a Ph.D degree in 2025 supervised by Prof. [Ross Murch](https://eermurch.home.ece.ust.hk/) (IEEE Fellow). Prior to my Ph.D. program, I received my B.E. from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST,华中科技大学) with honours degree in 2021.

My work in Ph.D period is primarily focused on the **integrated sensing and communication system (ISAC,通感一体化) based on radio tomographic imaging (RTI,无线层析成像)**, which mainly includes improving the sensing performance of RTI with the existing resource in ISAC system. Recently, I’m enthusiastic about the **combination of wireless communication system and reconfigurable antennas**.

I will join Huawei’s 2012 Wireless Technology Laboratory (华为2012无线技术实验室) soon.
